![MERN Todo Application](https://i.ibb.co/1M2z0zp/todo-application.png)

The MERN Todo Application is a simple, yet powerful todo list web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. This application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, Vanila js, and Node.js. It provides essential features such as adding, deleting, editing, and completing todos. Additionally, it includes some hidden features that make managing tasks even more convenient.

## Features

1. **Add Todo**: Easily add new tasks to your todo list by typing the task description and pressing the "Add" button.

2. **Delete Todo**: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks from the list with the "Delete" button.

3. **Edit Todo**: Made a mistake in the task description? No worries! Simply click the "Edit" button to modify the todo.

4. **Complete Todo**: When you finish a task, click the checkbox next to the todo to mark it as complete.

5. **Hidden Feature - Mouse Right Click**: Right-click on a todo item to quickly delete it without having to use the "Delete" button.

6. **Hidden Feature - Double Click**: Double-click on a todo item to mark it as complete without needing to click the checkbox.
